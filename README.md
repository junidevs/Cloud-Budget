Project has been created with :<br>
  create-react-app<br>
  pure scss without any css framework <br>
  html5 and css3 has been used as well<br>
  scroll to particural section has been implemented but I think there is the better way than write four functions<br>

Additional Options over project requirement:<br>

-scroll reveal has been implemented to each render via useEffect hook<br>

-page "SING UP" is something like a "my account" and there we can see our orders which we have been submited in Contact From Component<br>
and via local storage we are able to see the result<br>

-form validation to each field <br>
-required filds<br>
