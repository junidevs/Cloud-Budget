Project has been created with :
  create-react-app
  pure scss without any css framework 
  html5 and css3 has been used as well
  scroll to particural section has been implemented but I think there is the better way than write four functions

Additional Options over project requirement:

-scroll reveal has been implemented to each render via useEffect hook

-page "SING UP" is something like a "my account" and there we can see our orders which we have been submited in Contact From Component
and via local storage we are able to see the result

-form validation to each field 
-required filds
